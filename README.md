# Object_Detection_&_Traking_using_YOLOv8

This project demonstrates the use of YOLOv8 for object detection and segmentation. The application detects people in images, videos, YouTube URLs, and real-time webcam streams. Built with Streamlit, the project provides an interactive interface and supports integration with GitHub for collaboration and deployment.

## Features

1. **Object Detection**:
   - Detects people in images, videos, YouTube URLs, and webcam streams.
   - Powered by the YOLOv8 deep learning model for high accuracy and performance.

2. **Segmentation**:
   - Performs instance segmentation to delineate people in the input sources.
   - Outputs masks over detected objects for clear visualization.

3. **Input Sources**:
   - Static Images
   - Video Files
   - YouTube Video URLs
   - Real-time Webcam Feeds

4. **Streamlit Integration**:
   - Interactive web application with an intuitive user interface.
   - Easily upload files, view results, and experiment with various input sources.

5. **GitHub Integration**:
   - The project is structured for seamless collaboration and version control.
   - Pushes all code, datasets, and results to a public or private GitHub repository.
